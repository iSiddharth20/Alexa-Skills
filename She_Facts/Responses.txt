  'If she says its nothing, Beware!' , 

  'Dont ever forget the dates of when you met, when you first kissed or when is your anniversary.' , 

  'If she is angry for no reason, just feed her.' , 
  'Dont ever look at your classmates pic in front of her.' , 

  'Its okay for her to have a male bestfriend, but its also necessary to show him who you are.' , 

  'Is she cool with you not taking a bath daily or your regular five second rule while eating, marry her.' , 

  'So you think its cool to make her jealous and she will come at you with cute angry expressions, well, you are mistaken.', 

  'You need to know each person by their name and not by their story, just remember those 1000 names, its not that tough.' ,

  'So you think she is fighting over illogical aspects, just try explaining her, after a while, you will be accepting what she was saying in the first place.' ,

  'She might not express her feelings the way you want her to, but, if she deeply cares about you you will know.' ,

  'You might not be her first love, but if you are the last, you will know by looking in her eyes.' , 

  'If she is willing to go out of her comfort zone for you, you are special!'
